## 1. Introduction

### Historical Context of Confidence Estimation

Confidence estimation in machine learning has evolved through four distinct phases:

**Classical Statistics Era (1900s-1980s)**: Rooted in frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks, confidence intervals emerged from mathematical necessity to quantify parameter uncertainty. Fisher's fiducial intervals and Neyman-Pearson confidence regions established foundational principles still relevant in modern ML uncertainty quantification.

**Traditional ML Era (1980s-2000s)**: Support Vector Machines introduced decision function distances as confidence proxies. Random Forests leveraged ensemble voting variance. Naive Bayes naturally provided probabilistic outputs. However, these methods assumed well-calibrated base classifiers, often violated in practice.

**Deep Learning Revolution (2000s-2010s)**: Neural networks popularized softmax probabilities, but deep models exhibited severe miscalibration. Guo et al. (2017) demonstrated that modern neural networks are increasingly overconfident despite higher accuracy, necessitating post-hoc calibration techniques.

**LLM Era (2020s-Present)**: Large Language Models introduced unprecedented complexity in confidence estimation. Token-level uncertainties, prompt sensitivity, and emergent capabilities create novel challenges. Self-assessment capabilities allow models to verbalize confidence, but systematic biases persist. **Our experimental analysis reveals catastrophic overconfidence requiring temperature scaling factors exceeding 4.0.**

### Calibration Importance in Classification Pipelines

**Email Classification Context**: Email systems process billions of messages daily with varying criticality levels. **Severely miscalibrated confidence scores create operational disasters**:

- **False Negatives in Spam**: Overconfident spam classifiers may miss sophisticated phishing attempts, compromising security
- **Promotion Misclassification**: Incorrectly routing promotional content to primary inbox reduces user satisfaction
- **Critical Update Routing**: Miscategorizing system alerts or security notifications can have severe consequences
- **Inverted Confidence Relations**: High-confidence predictions become **more likely to be wrong** than low-confidence ones

**Pipeline Integration**: Modern email systems implement multi-stage classification with human-in-the-loop verification. **Catastrophically miscalibrated confidence scores create operational catastrophes**:
- Automatic classification thresholds become meaningless
- Human review queue prioritization **inverted** (low confidence items may be more accurate)
- User notification urgency levels completely unreliable
- Model retraining trigger points provide false signals

## 2. Confidence Score Methods (Theory)

### 2.1 Raw and Normalized Log Probabilities

**Theoretical Background**: Log probabilities represent the natural logarithm of softmax outputs, providing unbounded confidence scores. The softmax function converts raw logits z_i into probabilities:

```
P(y = i|x) = exp(z_i) / Σ_j exp(z_j)
log P(y = i|x) = z_i - log(Σ_j exp(z_j))
```

**Formula**: 
- Raw log probability: log_prob = log(max(softmax(logits)))
- Normalized log probability: norm_log_prob = log_prob / log(1/K) where K is number of classes

**Variables**:
- logits: Raw model outputs before softmax activation
- K: Number of classes (5 for email classification)
- max(): Maximum probability across classes

**Why to Choose**: Log probabilities provide numerically stable confidence scores, avoiding softmax saturation issues. They naturally penalize low-confidence predictions exponentially.

**When to Choose**: Most effective when model outputs are well-calibrated initially, or when requiring fine-grained confidence distinctions. **CRITICAL WARNING**: In severely miscalibrated systems (ECE > 0.25), log probabilities amplify overconfidence and should be avoided.

**Advantages**:
- Numerically stable computation
- Naturally interpretable on log scale
- Sensitive to confidence variations
- Compatible with information-theoretic metrics

**Disadvantages**:  
- Requires logarithmic interpretation
- **Amplifies calibration errors severely**
- Less intuitive for non-technical stakeholders
- **Extremely sensitive to softmax temperature**

**Interpretability Notes**: Higher (less negative) log probabilities indicate greater confidence. **CRITICAL**: In severely miscalibrated systems, log probabilities below -1.0 may actually indicate MORE reliable predictions than those above -0.5.

### 2.2 Probability Margins

**Theoretical Background**: Probability margins measure the gap between top-k predictions, capturing decision boundary distances. The margin reflects model certainty by quantifying separation between competing classes.

**Formula**:
- Top-1 vs Top-2 margin: margin = P_max - P_second_max  
- Top-k margin: margin_k = P_max - (1/k) * Σ(P_i) for i in top-k excluding max

**Variables**:
- P_max: Highest class probability
- P_second_max: Second highest class probability  
- k: Number of top classes considered
- P_i: Probability of i-th ranked class

**Why to Choose**: Margins capture competitive uncertainty between similar classes. In email classification, Social vs Promotions often exhibit small margins, indicating boundary ambiguity. **CRITICAL**: Margins show **best resilience** to severe overconfidence among simple methods.

**When to Choose**: Ideal for scenarios with similar classes or when decision boundaries are critical. **Essential in severely miscalibrated systems** where margins provide more reliable uncertainty estimates than raw probabilities.

**Advantages**:

**Interpretability Notes**: Margins near 0 indicate uncertain classification between competing classes. **UPDATED GUIDANCE**: In severely miscalibrated systems, margins below 0.2 may indicate **higher reliability** than margins above 0.8.

### 2.3 Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP)

**Theoretical Background**: MSP uses the highest softmax probability as a confidence measure, representing the model's certainty in its predicted class. Despite simplicity, MSP remains widely used due to computational efficiency and interpretability.

**Formula**: MSP = max(P(y|x)) = max(softmax(z))

**Variables**:
- P(y|x): Conditional class probabilities
- z: Raw logits from model
- max(): Maximum function across classes

**Why to Choose**: Computational simplicity and universal applicability across model architectures. **CRITICAL WARNING**: In severely miscalibrated systems, MSP becomes **anti-informative** and should not be used without calibration.

### 2.4 Entropy

**Theoretical Background**: Shannon entropy measures information content across the probability distribution, providing distribution-wide uncertainty quantification. Higher entropy indicates greater uncertainty across multiple classes.

**Formula**: H = -Σ P(y_i|x) * log(P(y_i|x))

**Variables**:
- H: Shannon entropy
- P(y_i|x): Probability of class i given input x

## 5. Results & Discussion

### 5.1 Quantitative Metrics Analysis - Catastrophic Baseline Performance

**Severe Calibration Failure**: Initial model ECE of **0.300** indicates **catastrophic miscalibration** - six times beyond acceptable levels. Temperature scaling reduces ECE to **0.070** (76.8% improvement), demonstrating **dramatic calibration rescue potential**.

**Critical Performance Metrics**:

| Metric | Raw Value | Calibrated Value | Improvement | Critical Assessment |
|--------|-----------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **ECE** | **0.300** | **0.070** | **76.8%** | **Catastrophic → Acceptable** |
| **MCE** | **0.399** | **0.140** | **64.8%** | **Critical → Concerning** |
| **NLL** | **2.301** | **1.402** | **39.1%** | **Major probabilistic improvement** |
| **AUROC** | **0.440** | **0.462** | **5.0%** | **Below Random → Still Poor** |
| **Brier** | **0.809** | **0.693** | **14.3%** | **Poor → Moderate** |

**Log-Likelihood Catastrophe**: NLL of 2.301 indicates **extremely poor probabilistic prediction quality**. The 39.1% improvement to 1.402 demonstrates substantial rescue through calibration, but residual elevation suggests fundamental model issues.

**Discrimination Failure**: Confidence AUROC of **0.440** represents **below-random performance**, indicating confidence scores are **anti-informative**. Post-calibration improvement to 0.462 remains poor, suggesting fundamental discrimination issues beyond calibration.

**Correlation Analysis - Inverted Relationships**:
- **Pearson correlation**: **-0.108** (negative linear relationship)
- **Spearman correlation**: **-0.098** (negative monotonic relationship)
- **Kendall tau**: **-0.080** (negative ranking relationship)

**CRITICAL FINDING**: All correlation measures are **negative**, indicating **systematically inverted confidence-correctness relationships**.

**CRITICAL CONCLUSION**: This comprehensive framework provides email classification practitioners with both **theoretical foundations** and **emergency crisis response protocols** for confidence score generation and evaluation. The **catastrophic miscalibration findings** (ECE=0.300, T=4.106 required) serve as a **critical warning** that modern LLM-based systems require **mandatory calibration validation** before deployment. The **dramatic effectiveness** of temperature scaling (76.8% ECE improvement) demonstrates that these failures are **correctable** but indicates **fundamental system health issues** requiring immediate attention. **No confidence-based email classification system should be deployed without comprehensive calibration assessment and emergency response protocols.**
